# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
An implementation of the Monte Carlo simulation to predict stock behavior. This project was a part of my data science internship in summer 2021.
In this project, we looked at data from the stock market, particularly some technology stocks. We used pandas to get stock information, visualized different aspects of it, and finally looked at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. 

We answered the following questions along the way:

1.) What was the change in price of the stock over time? 
2.) What was the daily return of the stock on average? 
3.) What was the moving average of the various stocks? 
4.) What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices? 
4.) What was the correlation between different stocks' daily returns? 
5.) How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock? 
6.) How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?
